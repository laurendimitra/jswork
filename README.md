# jswork


This is a repository of my Javascript work as it pertains to the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. 

In it you will find my journey from basic JS models- learning variable and loops, through to more advanced work like JQuery and constructors. 

The parameters of each activity are included within the html or JS files as comments for your edification on what the assignment was.
