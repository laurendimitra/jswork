//### Instructions

// * In groups of 4, begin the process of coding out the rock-paper-scissors game.

// **Rules for rock-paper-scissors**

// Rock: wins against scissors, loses to paper, and ties against itself.
// Paper: wins against rock, loses to scissors, and ties against itself.
// Scissors: wins against paper, loses to rock, and ties against itself.

// * Do as much as you can on your own, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel your team is struggling.

// * **NOTE:** Donâ€™t use `document.write` as it will delete the contents of your page including your JavaScript. Use `document.querySelector` or `document.getElementById`, alongside either `innerHTML` or `textContent`, to write to the DOM.

// * **NOTE:** Don't worry. We know this is a very challenging assignment. We also know that you won't know where to start. In fact, we haven't shown you EVERYTHING you need yet, but that's okay. Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error.
